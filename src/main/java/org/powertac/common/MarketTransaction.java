/**
 * A MarketTransaction instance represents a trade in the wholesale market.
 * It is created by the market, used by Accounting to update accounts, and
 * forwarded to the broker for its records. The values represent changes in
 * the broker's energy and cash balances, from the viewpoint of the broker.
 * Therefore, a positive price means that money will be deposited in the
 * broker's bank account, and a positive amount of energy means that the broker
 * has an additional quantity of energy in its account for the given timeslot.
