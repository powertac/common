/**
 * A Order instance represents a market (no price specified) or a limit
 * (min/max price specified) order in the PowerTAC wholesale market. Each Order
 * specifies an amount of energy in MWh, and a price in units. The quantities
 * represent the broker's view of the proposed transaction in terms of the
 * broker's energy and money accounts: positive quantities
 * of energy represent a proposal to buy power from another party and transfer
 * it to the broker. A positive quantity of energy is almost always accompanied 
 * by a negative price, which in turn represents money to be transfered out
 * of the broker's account to the other party in the transaction. So a buy order
 * is indicated by a positive energy quantity, and a sell order is indicated by
 * a negative energy quantity.
